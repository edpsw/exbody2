"""
This scripts shows how to retarget a motion clip from the source skeleton to a target skeleton.
Data required for retargeting are stored in a retarget config dictionary as a json file. This file contains:
  - source_motion: a SkeletonMotion npy format representation of a motion sequence. The motion clip should use the same skeleton as the source T-Pose skeleton.
  - target_motion_path: path to save the retargeted motion to
  - source_tpose: a SkeletonState npy format representation of the source skeleton in it's T-Pose state
  - target_tpose: a SkeletonState npy format representation of the target skeleton in it's T-Pose state (pose should match source T-Pose)
  - joint_mapping: mapping of joint names from source to target
  - rotation: root rotation offset from source to target skeleton (for transforming across different orientation axes), represented as a quaternion in XYZW order.
  - scale: scale offset from source to target skeleton
